More information can be found in the [Help](https://auranticus.github.io/iWriter/help.html) section.

## Features
- PNG icons are in SVG format to be consistent on most resolutions. Courtesy of https://www.svgrepo.com/.
- Fixed several bugs related to CSS.
- Optimized the Help section for smaller file size (it was bloated before due to Microsoft Word -> HTML).
- More information is added in the Models/My Writing section.
- Added new topics (more coming soon).
- De-bloated the tool.

## Known bugs
- The **Save** and **Save As** options are only available for Chromium browsers. Mozilla Firefox does not support them because it deprecated WebSQL in favor of IndexedDB.  
For Safari on iOS 13+, you need to disable **Disable Web SQL** in **Setting** > **Safari** > **Advanced** > **Experimental Features**.
