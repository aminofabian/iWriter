		<h2><a name="section_1"></a><a name="_1_What_is"></a>1 What is the Oxford iWriter?</h2>
		<p>The Oxford iWriter is an interactive tool designed to help you write more effectively in English. It provides models of many different types of writing and takes you through the key features of each one. It provides outline structures or <i>frameworks</i> for all the different types of writing, into which you can add your own content. For comparison and argument essays there are extra frameworks which allow you to structure your own essay in a slightly different way from the model essays. The iWriter helps you to plan, choose vocabulary, write, and check your own written work.</p>

		<h4>What help does the iWriter offer?</h4>
